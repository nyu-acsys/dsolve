pattern binds at source toplevel
DON'T USE show (too tricky)
DON'T USE diverge (use assert false)
nested recursives
(possibly) measures over nested recursives
-> measures and complex pattern matches (what does the shape of the matched variable look like?)

rule from paper L_product not followed (e0... not bound in consgen)
* solved by nosimple or adding subt in consgen for tuple or implementing paper rule (dependencies on other code?)

add: more general z3 type casting

fix: wellformedness should start using ml types (and we should guarantee an ml type for every id) to get rid of the hack for unifying functions with arguments
