This package is a demonstration and patch for what seems to be a minor flaw in
the recursive balancing procedure in vec. In particular, when handed some particularly
shaped input vectors which are internally balanced such that all subchildren are off in
height by at most two, the recbal procedure can end up outputting a tree in which subchildren
are off in height by as much as four.
