A list of the dsolve source files by directory follows.  Anything not
listed is not source or part of the OCaml standard distribution.

The top level is roughly sorted by importantance, lower levels
alphabetically.

./

  dsolve.py
    Wrapper around the liquid binary which generates qualifiers and
    runs the analyzer.
    Used as a library by the regression test script, regrtest.py.

  regrtest.py
    Regression test harness.

liquid/

  builtins.ml
    Definitions of "built-in" values, e.g., those defined in the
    standard library or Pervasives module.

  constraint.ml
    The constraint solver, including functions for instantiating
    qualifiers.

  frame.ml
    Definition of and functions for manipulating type templates.

  lightenv.ml
    Environment data type; basically just a thin wrapper over Map.

  liqerrors.ml
    Error-reporting code.

  liquid.ml
    The main Liquid analyzer; entry points for qualifier generation
    and type inference.

  measure.ml
    Translates and maintains a list of measures after parsing,
    correlates measure definitions in mlq files with their types in
    the ML code.

  normalize.ml
    Translates a source file's AST to a normalized form
    (A-normalization, pattern match desugaring, etc.).

  pattern.ml
    Operations on ML patterns.

  qdebug.ml
    Pretty-printing functions useful for debugging.

  qdump.ml
    Outputs generated qualifiers from input ML AST and qualifier
    patterns.

  qualifier.ml
    Definition of and operations on the qualifier data type.

  qualifymod.ml
    Type inference driver over an ML module; generates constraints
    over the AST before handing it off to the solver.

  theoremProver.ml
    General theorem prover interface specification.

  theoremProverYices.ml
    Interface to the yices theorem prover.

  wellformed.ml
    Functions for checking the well-formedness of a qualifier in an
    environment.

typing/

  common.ml
    Miscellaneous utility functions.

  predicate.ml
    Functions for constructing and manipulating logical predicates.

  qualdecl.ml
    Translates qualifier declarations to qualifier data structures
    after parsing.

parsing/

  parser.mly
    The OCaml parser, which has been augmented with various
    Liquid-related productions.

utils/

  misc.ml
    Miscellaneous utility functions.
