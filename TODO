1. run with -qprover
./liquid.run -qprover gauss.ml

2. switch on the thing that dumps the last qprover query to file

DEBUG above...

3. switch off the "close_over_env" see if you get any hits with qprover

4. implement separation constraints for qprover ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Well-formedness doesn't pay any attention to the _types_ of free
variables in a refinement.  In other words, if you have a predicate
"Q(x): x < a", and a appears in contexts where it's not an int, the
thing's gonna crap out.

Likewise, there is not typechecking before asserting the background
predicate.  Background predicates that don't typecheck should probably
be taken as false.
