pattern binds at source toplevel
DON'T USE SHOW (not broken just don't do it)
DON'T USE diverge (use assert false)
nested recursives
(possibly) measures over nested recursives
-> measures and complex pattern matches (what does the shape of the matched variable look like?)

rule from paper L_product not followed (e0... not bound in consgen)
* solved by nosimple or adding subt in consgen for tuple or implementing paper rule (dependencies on other code?)

add: type casting at z3 interface with 1-1 casting functions (by default. absent bugs, simulates polymorphism)
add: implicitly quantified types: forall i. (j: int -> 'a [j/i]) k: int -> 'a [k/i]
add: extension to constructed types

fix: wellformedness should totally start using ml types (and we should guarantee an ml type for every id) to get rid of the hack for unifying functions with arguments
