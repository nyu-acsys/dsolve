1. rj1.ml : SCC get_rank fails on open function
2. rj2.ml : WF constraints don't get solved

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Well-formedness doesn't pay any attention to the _types_ of free
variables in a refinement.  In other words, if you have a predicate
"Q(x): x < a", and a appears in contexts where it's not an int, the
thing's gonna crap out.

Likewise, there is not typechecking before asserting the background
predicate.  Background predicates that don't typecheck should probably
be taken as false.
