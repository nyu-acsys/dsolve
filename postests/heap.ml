(*s Heaps *)

(* Heaps are encoded as complete binary trees, i.e., binary trees
   which are full expect, may be, on the bottom level.
   These trees also enjoy the heap property, namely the value of any node
   is greater or equal than those of its left and right subtrees.

   The representation invariant is the following: the number of nodes in
   the left subtree is equal to the number of nodes in the right
   subtree, or exceeds it by exactly once. In the first case, we use
   the constructor [Same] and in the second the constructor [Diff].
   Then it can be proved that [2^(h-1) <= n <= 2^h] when [n] is the
   number of elements and [h] the height of the tree. *)
