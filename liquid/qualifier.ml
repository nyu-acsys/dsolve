(* The user specifies qualifiers as open predicates - i.e., the variables named
   in the qualifier may not yet be in scope at the time of definition.  But
   we want qualifiers that refer to OCaml paths, which are unique, not
   variable names, which can appear multiple times.  Using variable names
   instead of unique paths would cause trouble with the following expression:

   let a = 1 in
   let x = a + 1 in   (* x has type {v : int | v > a} *)
   let a = 3 in ...   (* x's type is now incorrect *)

   This function replaces all instances of named variables in a qualifier with
   the unique paths of the same name in the given environment.  It raises
   Refinement_not_closed if a variable in the qualifier is not found in the
   environment. *)
