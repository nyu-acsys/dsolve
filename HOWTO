Running ocaml-liquid
====================

To run the liquid analyzer on an ocaml file, simply invoke:

./liquid <source file>

To generate an annotation file, run with the -dframes option:

./liquid -dframes <source file>

Sometimes the types have predicates like "(= V (+ __tmp0 1))".  This is due to
A-normalization.  To get around this, you can run without A-normalization:

./liquid -no-anormal <source file>

Lots of programs will not typecheck without A-normalization.

For more options, run:

./liquid -help

Writing Qualifiers
==================

Qualifiers look like this:

qualif CapitalizedName(x): x <= 10

To be safe, these should be at the top of the file.
